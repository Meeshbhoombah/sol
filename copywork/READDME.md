# Copywork
Copywork is a piece of writing that is worthy of duplication.

Often, this is because that piece of work is exeplementary. Although generally
discussed in writing, I thought I may benefit in improving my Solidity skills 
by doing some copywork of Smart Contracts. This repository contains Smart 
Contracts I've duplicated, by writing them out, for the sake of improving my
Solidity skills and knowledge.
